      <p>As part of our <a href="https://rmotr.com/web-development-with-django">Web Development with Django</a> course, we give our students good resources from different Django conferences. Django has an amazing community and experts from everywhere give talks about different topics. 🙌</p>
      <p>It's also a great resource for learning Django development 🤓. The project is structured in a way that <strong>makes it easy to walk through</strong> the different phases of the project development.</p>
      <p>We know that most of you trying to learn Django are <strong>tired of dumb tutorials that fall short</strong>. This project can provide a comprehensive guide and demonstration of what a production-ready Django project looks like.</p>
